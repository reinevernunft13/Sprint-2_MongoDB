# 2.4. Database Queries in MongoDB ðŸ‘€

## Unit Tasks ðŸ“‘

- Query data in MongoDB from a pre-given data collection, 'restaurants.json';

## Solution ðŸ¤“

- Note that we're given a restaurant collection in JSON format, but, unless already created, no MongoDB currently exists. Therefore, the first step is to create it. There are many ways to do this. I've chosen to do it by means of a script that will create a database and insert the JSON.file data into a collection called 'restaurants'.

- A list of query tasks can be found in file 'description_queries'

## Usage instructions ðŸ‘‡

> **STEP 1** - Run the script 'restaurants.js' by running the command:

````
mongosh localhost:27017/test restaurants.js
````

> **STEP 2** - Connect to database restaurants_db. 

- Use the MongoDB VS Code plugin (icon should be visible on left bar); 
- Select the database restaurants_db.

> **STEP 3** > Test the queries.

- Open the file 'queries_restaurants.mongodb' and press plugin button to run them all from playground.
