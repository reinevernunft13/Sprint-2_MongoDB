# Sprint-2: MongoDB ðŸ“š

In this unit, we'll be introduced to **'NoSQL'** (a.k.a. non-relational databases) through MongoDB. NoSQL is an approach to database design that provides an alternative mechanism for storing andâ€¯queryingâ€¯data to traditional SQL databases, such as MySQL. Instead of storing data records in tabular format, as is the case in MySQL, MongoDB stores them in collections of documents (objects) in a format called BSON -- a binary serialization of JSON-like structures. 
## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- **MongoDB** > Install MongoDB Community Edition. Details [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-enterprise/)
- **MongoDB extension for VS Code** > Check [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mongodb.mongodb-vscode)

## ðŸ‘‡ Contents

The structure of the project is divided into two parts, each contained in a different folder:

- **2.3. Database structure in MongoDB**
- **2.4. Database queries in MongoDB**

You will find a README.md file in each folder with specific usage instructions and notes.
